                    Disclaimer:
                    This is just a "sidenote" kind of project that I do to occupy myself. It helps me
                    "vent" my otherwise would-be-wasted bored time, and I get to think too. I know you're like, "What would I be thinking about..." Well, I'm not
                    going to tell you any of that, that's between me and the dark room at the back of my head holding the
                    thoughts. Ok, enough about me, I love writing, I could go on forever.</strong>

                        Well, besides venting and all that, I do this to stay "hydrated" with html and for marketing. Personally, I think basic
                        web designing skills are essential for any computing student, like, say ironing to a tailor: you get
                        the point. At the time of writing, I actually didn't know the difference between "taylor" and "tailor."
                        Little pointless easter egg but why not put it here. When I was starting this I actually did not know
                        how far I was going to take it. So far, I like it. It isnt much, but I'm proud of it.
                        <br>
                        Ok, back to marketing, I'm an "IT Guy" so <a href="contact.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit me up</a> if you need a fix.

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
                        very popular during the Renaissance.
                        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
